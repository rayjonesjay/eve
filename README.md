# eve - a bitcoin library

Eve is a bitcoin library written in rust that I am developing as part of my journey to understand blockchain, bitcoin,
and the whole web3 ecosystem. The project is still in its initial stages and estimated completion time is 3 months.

I am good with golang too. If you have any opportunities you can reach out to me using the socials on my profile.
